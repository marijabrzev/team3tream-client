## Problem Space

We wanted to address the issue that people can't decide what to watch, and often times, give up on looking.
We designed a custom script that will suggest related movies, based on a users initial selection. This script pulls from a movie API and in future sprints, we would expand on this feature, making it the focal point of the service.

Ideally, we would impliment an Open-Ai API key that a user can interact with to truely get an interactive and custom experience.

This approach increases engagement and could be implimented into a new service OR an existing service.
